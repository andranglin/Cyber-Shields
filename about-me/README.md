# About Me

My name is Adrian Anglin, and I am a cybersecurity professional passionate about all aspects of information security. However, most of my time is spent doing Incident Response, Digital Forensics, Threat Hunting and other cyber defence-related activities. Over the years, I have studied various areas of cybersecurity and hold several degrees and industry certifications; I am a cybersecurity enthusiast at heart and a continuous learner. Therefore, this site reflects my experiences, the courses taken, books, blogs, and other content shared by the broader community, which has helped to develop me into the professional I am today. For that, I say thanks to the others who have shared their knowledge and expertise with the community.

The objective is to share my experiences, create a space for continuous learning, and help other community members, especially those new to the field. The aim is to provide some theoretical and practical approaches to help others delve deeper into the defence aspects of cybersecurity. The content on the site reflects the tools, processes and methodologies I have used and am familiar with. I am aware it's not possible to cover all areas at a level appropriate for everyone; therefore, I will refer to other online resources that I think may be helpful. Against goal is to help others who are new to defensive cybersecurity.&#x20;

A significant part of our field is the willingness of others to share their research, knowledge and expertise. I will refer to the content of other professionals whose work has helped my development.

Thanks for stopping by.
