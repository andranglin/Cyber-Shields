# Incident Response - Windows

### Introduction

Managing incident response on Windows can be challenging, especially given the evolving landscape of cyber threats and the increasing complexity of the Windows ecosystem.

#### Current Challenges in Windows Incident Response

1. **Sophisticated Threats**: Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, with attackers using advanced techniques like AI-driven automation and deepfake technology to bypass traditional defences.
2. **Resource Constraints**: There is a significant shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, which makes it difficult for organisations to effectively manage incident response.
3. **Complex Ecosystem**: The broad and open nature of the Windows ecosystem adds to the complexity of incident management. Organisations need to stay updated with the latest tools and best practices to ensure resilience.
4. **Insider Threats**: Insider threats remain a significant concern, with attackers leveraging social engineering and other tactics to gain access to sensitive information.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Organisations must navigate a complex regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with various data protection and cybersecurity regulations.

#### Essential Commands and Tools for Windows Incident Response

Managing incidents on Windows often involves utilising existing tools built into the system (PowerShell) or various commercial and open-source toolkits, scripts and other utilities. In the subsections of this page, we explore essential commands for incident response on Windows. The commands, tools, and other content discussed are information gathered from training, day-to-day activities, and various internet sources. A list of resources used and for additional research is provided at the end of each subsection.

The commands used and the resources list are not exhaustive; however, they will serve as a guide for those looking for pathways.
