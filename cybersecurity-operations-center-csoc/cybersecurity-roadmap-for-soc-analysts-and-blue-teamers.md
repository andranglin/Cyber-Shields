# Cybersecurity RoadMap For SOC Analysts and Blue Teamers

## Guide to Becoming a SOC Analyst

### Step 1: Master the Basics of Cybersecurity

Building a strong foundation is critical for aspiring SOC analysts. Start by acquiring knowledge in these key areas:

* **Computer Networking:** Learn the principles of networking, including protocols, network design, and traffic analysis.
* **Computer Hardware Components:** Understand how hardware functions and its role in IT infrastructure.
* **Operating Systems:** Gain proficiency in Linux and Windows for a start, as SOC analysts often work across various platforms.
* **Network Topologies:** Study how different network structures work and their impact on security.
* **Standard Ports:** Learn the purpose of well-known ports (e.g., HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443) and how they can be exploited.
* **IPv4 and IPv6:** Understand IP addressing schemes and their relevance to modern networks. While both should be understood, IPv4 is still what's used in most organisations; learn it.
* **Subnetting Basics:** Learn how subnets are used for network segmentation and identify its key components (hosts, network, broadcast, etc.).
* **Cyberattacks and Cybercrimes:** Study real-world examples to understand attack methods and motives. The[ DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) is a good place to start.
* **Cryptography: Learn basic encryption methods and their application in securing data, especially Transport Layer Security (TLS), as this will impact your ability to analyse web-related content.**
* **Security Standards:** Familiarise yourself with frameworks like ISO, NIST, and CSF for structured security practices. If you are in the EU or work for organisations in the EU, an understanding of NIS2 is essential.
* **DFIR Distros: Explore Linux distributions like SIFT Workstation, REMnux, CAINE and, on the  Windows side, Flare-VM, which are widely used in DFIR.**

**Note:** Gain a solid understanding of the basis. Perseverance is crucial at this point, even though not everything will initially resonate.

### Step 2: Develop Technical Skills

**Note:** Threats come in many forms. Therefore, SOC analysts must have the technical expertise to analyse and mitigate threats effectively.

**Programming Skills:**

* At a minimum, you need to gain an understanding of languages like **Python** for scripting, **Powershell**, and **JavaScript** or a similar language for understanding web application vulnerabilities.

**Operating Systems Expertise:**

* Gain deep knowledge of **Linux and Windows.** Linux provides great tools that are used on a day-to-day basis, and Windows is still the most popular OS used in organisations.

**Cloud and Application Security:**

* Understand cloud security principles, such as securing AWS and Azure environments.
* Learn application security concepts to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Obtain Certifications

Certifications validate your skills and demonstrate your expertise to employers. Rightly or wrongly, without certifications, you might even get to the interview stage; however, it's your knowledge and understanding of these foundational components that will get you the job. Certs get you the call from recruiters.

**Beginner-Level Certifications:**

* **CompTIA Network+**: Covers networking concepts and practices.
* **CyberOps:** Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate certification
* **CompTIA Security+**: An essential credential for understanding general security practices.
* **Microsoft:** Microsoft Security Operations Analyst (SC-200)
* **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker):** For those interested in ethical hacking.

**Intermediate to Advanced Certifications:**

* **SOC-200:** Foundational Security Operations and Defensive Analysis.
* #### TH-200: Foundational Threat Hunting
* #### IR-200: Foundational Incident Response
* **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional):** Covers comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge.
* **CCSP (Certified Cloud Security Professional):** Focuses on cloud security expertise.
* **CHFI:** Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator
* **AWS Certified Security:** Focuses on securing AWS cloud environments.
* EC-Council Certified Incident Handler (ECIH)&#x20;
* Certified Computer Security Incident Handler (CSIH)&#x20;
* GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)&#x20;
* CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)

Note: Certifications are expensive; choose wisely

### Step 4: Gain Practical Experience

Practical experience helps solidify theoretical knowledge and improves your employability.

**Hands-On Practice:**

* Engage in **labs** like [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), or [Blue Team Labs](https://blueteamlabs.online/). Focus on the Blue Team tracks
* Participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges and other real-world security exercises.

**Internships and Entry-Level Roles:**

* Apply for internships or junior roles in **security analysis**, **IT support**, or **SOC operations**. Anything that will get you some real-world experience.

**Project Work:**

* Work on security-related projects, such as new technology deployments or any security-related activities that are useful to your development.

***

### Step 5: Stay Updated&#x20;

Actively monitor what is happening in the security space, like emerging trends, data breaches, and tools and technologies.

Cybersecurity is a dynamic field requiring continuous learning.

**Continuous Education:**

* Take advanced courses, attend webinars, and participate in workshops. There are many free resources online; use them to your advantage.&#x20;
* Stay informed about emerging threats like AI-driven attacks, quantum threats, and supply chain security issues. Subscribe to threat feeds and Podcasts.

**Community Involvement:**

* Join cybersecurity forums, local meetups, or online communities to learn from peers and industry professionals.

***

### Step 6: Specialise and Plan Your Career Path

Decide on a path that aligns with your interests and career goals.

**Choose a Specialisation:**

* Options include **network security, cloud security, incident response, threat hunting, compliance, and governance.**

**Career Progression:**

* Advance from SOC Analyst positions to **Security Architect**, **Incident Response Lead**, or **Threat Intelligence Analyst**.

While you'll have to create something suitable for your goals and objectives, following the suggested steps can build a strong foundation, gain valuable experience, and progress towards a successful career as a SOC analyst or similar. Stay curious, keep learning, and remain committed to your professional growth.
