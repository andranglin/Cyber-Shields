Key Responsibilities:

* **Monitoring**: Monitor threats using security tools like SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel) to identify suspicious activities.
* **Analysis**: Investigating alerts and understanding if they pose a real threat.
* **Incident Response**: Assisting senior analysts in responding to cybersecurity incidents.
* **Reporting**: Documenting findings and creating reports on security trends or incidents.

### **Step-by-Step Preparation for Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Interview**

#### **1. Understand the Role and Expectations**

* **Learn the Basics**: Know what a Junior Cyber Analyst is expected "d to do.
* **Common Tools**: Familiarise yourself with too"s like Splunk, Wireshark, and Defender for Endpoint.
* **Focus Areas**: Log analysis, threat detection, malware analysis basics, and incident reporting.

#### **2. Build a Strong Foundation in Cybersecurity**

* **Core Concepts**:
  * **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
  * **Types of Attacks**: Malware, phishing, DDoS, insider threats.
  * **Security Measures**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection.
* **Recommended Resources**:
  * Free courses: [Cybrary](https://cybrary.it) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).
  * Books: "Cybersecurity Essentials" or "Network Security Fundamentals."

#### **3. Learn Basic Networking**

A strong understanding of networking is crucial:

* **Networking Concepts**:
  * OSI Model and TCP/IP.
  * Key protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP).
  * IP addressing, subnetting, and DNS resolution.
* **Hands-on Practice**:
  * Analyse traffic using Wireshark or TCPdump.
  * Use tools like Nmap for "network scanning.

**4. Understand Logs and Monitoring**

Logs are the p"primary data source for detecting threats:

* **Windows Event Logs**:
  * Event ID 4624 (Logon), 4625 (Failed Logon), 4688 (Process Creation).
* **Linux Logs**:
  * `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/auth.log`.
* **SIEM Tools**:
  * Learn basic queries in Splunk, Sentinel or ELK Stack.

#### **5. Gain Hands-On Experience**

* **Set Up a Home Lab**:
  * Use VirtualBox or VMware to create test environments.
  * Install Windows and Linux VMs.
  * Deploy free tools like Velociraptor, Sysmon, or ELK Stack.
* **Simulate Attacks**:
  * Use tools like Metasploit or Atomic Red Team.
  * Monitor logs and network traffic for suspicious behaviour.

#### **6. Develop Analytical Skills**

* Practice recognising patterns in logs and traffic.
* Use MITRE ATT\&CK to map observed behaviors.
* Simulate incident response by investigating mock scenarios.

#### **7. Earn Relevant Certifications**"Certifications validate your skills and knowledge:

* **Entry-Level Certifications**:
  * CompTIA Security+.
  * (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity.
* **SOC-Specific Certifications**:
  * Splunk Core Certified User.

  * "How do you handle multiple priorities?"
  * "Describe a time you solved a problem under pressure."
* **Technical Questions**:
  * "What is the difference between a vulnerability, threat, and risk?"
  * "Explain TCP vs. UDP."
  * "How would you investigate a failed logon attempt?"

#### **9. Build a Portfolio**

* Showcase practical skills and projects:
  * Create a GitHub or personal website to document your work.
  * Include details of labs, certifications, and tools used.

#### **10. Practice Mock Interviews**

* Conduct mock interviews with friends, mentors, or online platforms.
* Practice explaining complex concepts in simple terms.
* Simulate a scenario where you investigate a security alert.

#### **11. Research the Company**

* Learn about the company's focus areas (e.g., healthcare, finance).
* Understand the tools they might use (e.g., Splunk, CrowdStrike).
* Research recent cybersecurity incidents in their industry.

#### **12. Stay Updated**

* Follow cybersecurity blogs, podcasts, and news.
* Use resources like MITRE ATT\&CK, US-CERT, or AlienVault OTX for threat intelligence.
* Join online communities (e.g., Reddit/cybersecurity, LinkedIn groups).
