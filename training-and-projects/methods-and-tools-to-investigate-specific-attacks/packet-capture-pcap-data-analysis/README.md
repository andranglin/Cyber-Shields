# Packet Capture (pcap) Data Analysis

### <mark style="color:blue;">What is Packet Capture (PCAP) Data Analysis?</mark>

**Packet Capture (PCAP) data analysis** is the process of examining raw network traffic data captured in PCAP files to understand the behaviour of network communication. A PCAP file contains detailed records of all packets exchanged on a network during a specific timeframe, including their metadata and payload.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Importance in Network Forensics:</mark>

PCAP data analysis is critical for:

1. **Incident Investigation**:
   * Identifying malicious activities such as unauthorised access, data exfiltration, or malware communication.
2. **Threat Hunting**:
   * Detecting suspicious patterns, anomalies, or specific indicators of compromise (IoCs).
3. **Protocol Analysis**:
   * Understanding the behaviour of protocols (e.g., DNS, HTTP, FTP) and uncovering vulnerabilities.
4. **Network Performance Monitoring**:
   * Diagnosing issues like latency, packet loss, or misconfigured devices.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Key Components Analysed in PCAP:</mark>

* **IP addresses**: Source and destination of packets.
* **Ports**: Identify services or applications communicating (e.g., HTTP on port 80).
* **Protocols**: Types of traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
* **Payloads**: Content of the communication, often revealing sensitive data or malicious activity.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Tools for PCAP Analysis:</mark>

* **Wireshark**: Graphical tool for deep-dive analysis.
* **TShark**: Command-line version of Wireshark for scriptable workflows.
* **Ngrep**: Lightweight tool for searching payloads with regex.
* **Tcpdump**: Command-line tool for capturing and filtering traffic.

PCAP data analysis is an indispensable process in cybersecurity. It provides visibility into network activities and enables organisations to detect and respond to cyber threats.
